# rock-paper-scissors-alex2

### overview:
- i chose rock, paper, scissors because i could demonstrate html, css, and javascript altogether.
- game concept is straightforward but i could use enough of my javascript knowledge to demosntrate my skills
- rock, paper, scissors demostrates the basic javascript functions.
- shortened my code from lots of if else statements to just 2.

### challenges:
- sometimes javascript did not update changes despite being functional
- also encountered this problem when introducing a tally tracking player wins
