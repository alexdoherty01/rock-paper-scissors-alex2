# rock-paper-scissors-alex2

### overview:
- I chose rock, paper, scissors because I could demonstrate html, css, and javascript altogether.
- Game concept is straightforward but I could use enough of my javascript knowledge to demosntrate my skills.
- rock, paper, scissors demostrates the basic javascript functions.
- Shortened my code from an abundance of "if else" statements to just 2.
- Referenced web3schools for help with creating a modal div.

### challenges:
- Sometimes javascript did not update changes despite being functional
- Also encountered this problem when introducing a tally tracking player wins
- Using style.display = block wasn't giving the result I wanted so I changed it to add/remove a class called "hidden" which doensntdoes not change the display type
- Encountered a difficulty with closing the hints button. Despite the code being correct, the button refused to function. However, I noted that if I implemented any other changes to my workspace, the page itself wouldn't pick up on it. The persisting problem was cache related however decaching my webpage still didn't resolve my issue either. I restarted my laptop entirely and closed all work related tabs. Fortunately, the hints button was able to close and all new changes were implemented.
